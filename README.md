Hello there and thank you for joining us for [Microsoft Build 2020](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/)!

Since we don't get to be with you in person this year, we decided to re-think swag a little bit and thus, 
this repo was born. We have taken the new designs for Build this year and turned it into a collection of 
digital swag that's free for you to use and share! 

In this collection you'll find desktop wallpapers, Apple Watch faces, and Twitter headers in a mix of dark
and light themes. 

As a plus, [Kayla Cinnamon](https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft) has offered to share her collection of developer
themed Apple Watch faces!

We hope you enjoy everything we've put together this year for Build.
